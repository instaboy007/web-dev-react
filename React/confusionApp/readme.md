The Node module, json-server, provides a very simple way to set up a web server that supports a full-fledged REST API server. It can also serve up static web content from a folder. 

Installing json-server
      npm install json-server -g
    
Configuring the Server

    Download the confusionApp.

    Move to this folder in your terminal window, and type the following at the command prompt to start the server:

    json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000

This should start up a server at port number 3001 on your machine. 
The data from this server can be accessed by typing the following addresses into your browser address bar:

http://localhost:3001/dishes
http://localhost:3001/promotions
http://localhost:3001/leaders
http://localhost:3001/feedback

Type these addresses into the browser address and see the JSON data being served up by the server. This data is obtained from the db.json file

The json-server also provides a static web server. Any resources that you put in a folder named public in the json-server folder above, will be served by the server at the following address:

http://localhost:3001/

Shut down the server by typing ctrl-C in the terminal window.
